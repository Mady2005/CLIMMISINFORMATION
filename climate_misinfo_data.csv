Climate change is killing fireflies – threatening a US summer ritual,"<p>Max Vogel, a 29-year-old public defense attorney, was picnicking with friends in early August at Prospect Park in Brooklyn, New York, when he noticed flashes of light appear in the air around him.</p> <p>They were fireflies, bioluminescent insects that the Washington DC native had not seen while living in Oregon, where there are few, if any. For many Americans who live where fireflies do, their flashing lights at dusk are a tangible rite of summer – though one that may now be under threat.</p> <p>While Vogel did not notice their absence out west, once “you’re back on the east coast and you see them, you’re like, that’s so crazy”, Vogel said. “It’s like a shooting star that just is surprising and gives you the childlike wonder of how you felt when you first saw fireflies in your yard.”</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/01/monarch-butterflies-mass-die-off-pesticides"">Monarch butterflies’ mass die-off in 2024 caused by pesticide exposure – study</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even in areas of the US where there are typically fireflies, people are especially excited to see them this year because there appear to be more this summer after a <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/22/why-lights-going-out-fireflies-conservation-pollution"">steady decline</a> in recent years, according to scientists.</p> <p>Despite that welcome news, researchers caution that it does not necessarily signal a reversal of the downward trend. They remain concerned about the long-term viability of the firefly family, which includes more than 2,000 species, some of which are at risk of extinction due to factors such as light pollution and climate change.</p> <p>“It’s been really uplifting to hear all of the reports of huge increases in fireflies,” said Candace Fallon, senior endangered species conservation biologist for the Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation. “But they are also insects, and insects are notorious for having populations that bounce up and down each year, and so it’s hard to say that their populations are increasing from a single year of data.”</p> <p>Fireflies, also known as lightning bugs, are beetles that come out at night during summer and produce a bioluminescent gleam, primarily to attract a mate.</p> <p>Cultures around the world treasure the bugs, including in Japan, where they <a href=""https://www.wired.com/story/how-a-firefly-course-is-saving-japans-favorite-glowing-insect/"">are symbols</a> of <a href=""https://sugoiinu.wordpress.com/2012/09/25/the-light-of-the-firefly-what-is-its-role-in-japanese-culture/"">love and fallen soldiers.</a></p> <p>Since <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1991/07/05/fireflies-the-flicker-of-childhood/1eff126b-b6f2-4f35-89b7-594a741c71a7/"">ancient</a> times, people have also collected them, venturing out with receptacles on hot, sticky nights.

But the scientists also did not have enough data on more than half of the assessed species to determine their extinction risks, which means that more of the beetles could be in danger, Fallon said.</p> <p>The primary factor behind fireflies’ decline is habitat loss and degradation, according to the <a href=""https://www.xerces.org/endangered-species/fireflies"">Xerces Society</a>. That includes land being disrupted by development, light pollution and pesticide use.</p> <p>Artificial lighting at night makes it hard for the bugs to communicate and mate, Fallon said.</p> <p>Climate change, including an increase in droughts and rising sea levels, also affect firefly populations, she said.</p> <p>Still, there are some firefly species that appear to be doing “just fine”, Schlesinger said.</p> <p>The kinds that specialize in particular habitats are the ones struggling, Schlesinger said.</p> <p>Scientists say the lightning bugs’ apparent revival is probably due to <a href=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/weather/2025/07/15/why-is-it-raining-so-much/85206458007/"">increased rainfall</a> this year.</p> <p>“If they can still have a big year, at least those species are probably doing fine and have the potential to recover,” Schlesinger said. That said, “any single year doesn’t tell you about the long-term trajectory of firefly populations, just like any particular year that is colder doesn’t mean that global warming isn’t happening.”</p> <p>Riley Witzl, five, was still able to find some in a St Louis suburb.</p> <p>“It was fun,” said Riley, who is entering kindergarten. “I liked chasing them and holding them.”</p> <p>Kids should continue the tradition of venturing out with jars in the summer but should then release the bugs rather than collecting them, Schlesinger said.</p> <p>Other ways to help fireflies survive include: not using pesticides, reducing artificial lighting at night, and allowing the grass to grow long and the <a href=""https://blog.nwf.org/2024/09/leave-the-leaves-to-save-fireflies/"">leaves to pile up</a> in your yard.</p> <p>“A lot of fireflies pupate in leaves, and so when we rake those and put them in bags, we’re destroying their habitat at a very small scale,” Schlesinger said.</p> <p>Despite the concerns about extinction, Fallon is encouraged by <a href=""https://www.arkansasmasternaturalists.org/content.aspx?page_id=4002&amp;club_id=250502&amp;item_id=2589196"">master gardeners</a> in Arkansas who created a firefly sanctuary, and by lawmakers in Maryland who <a href=""https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/mgawebsite/Legislation/Details/hb0452?ys=2025RS"">approved legislation</a> earlier this year which introduces new regulations on what type of lighting can be bought with state funds.</p> <p>She thinks people are more aware of and concerned about the firefly population decline.</p> <p>“Charisma is a big part of it; people connect with fireflies,” Fallon said, of why people care about their survival. “I think we have enough time to make a difference. Even small pockets of habitat can be really crucial for these species. But I think we definitely need to assess our priorities and decide: are we going to take action?”</p> <p>• This article was amended on 11 August 2025 to remove a reference to the big dipper firefly.</p>",news
"Chemical pollution a threat comparable to climate change, scientists warn","<p>Chemical pollution is “a threat to the thriving of humans and nature of a similar order as climate change” but decades behind global heating in terms of public awareness and action, a report has warned.</p> <p>The industrial economy has created <a href=""https://planet-tracker.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Novel-Entities.pdf"">more than 100 million</a> “novel entities”, or chemicals not found in nature, with <a href=""https://icca-chem.org/news/how-do-we-calculate-the-number-of-chemicals-in-use-around-the-globe/"">somewhere between</a> 40,000 and 350,000 in commercial use and production, the report says. But the environmental and human health effects of this widespread contamination of the biosphere are not widely appreciated, in spite of a growing body of evidence linking chemical toxicity with effects ranging from ADHD to infertility to cancer.</p> <p>“I suppose that’s the biggest surprise for some people,” Harry Macpherson, senior climate associate at Deep Science Ventures (DSV), which carried out <a href=""https://www.deepscienceventures.com/toxicity"">the research</a>, told the Guardian.</p> <p>“Maybe people think that when you walk down the street breathing the air; you drink your water, you eat your food; you use your personal care products, your shampoo, cleaning products for your house, the furniture in your house; a lot of people assume that there’s really great knowledge and huge due diligence on the chemical safety of these things. But it really isn’t the case.”</p> <p>Over eight months, as part of a project funded by the Grantham Foundation, Macpherson and colleagues spoke to dozens of researchers, non-profit leaders, entrepreneurs and investors, and analysed hundreds of scientific papers.</p> <p>According to the DSV report, more than 3,600 synthetic chemicals from food contact materials – the materials that are used in food preparation and packaging – alone are found in human bodies, 80 of which are of significant concern. Pfas “forever chemicals”, for example, have been found in nearly all humans tested, and are now so ubiquitous that in many locations even rainwater contains levels regarded as unsafe to drink. Meanwhile, more than 90% of the global population breathes air that breaches World Health Organization (WHO) pollution guidelines.</p> <p>When these chemicals contaminate our bodies, the results can be disastrous. The report found there were correlational or causal data linking widely used chemicals with threats to human reproductive, immune, neurological, cardiovascular, respiratory, liver, kidney and metabolic systems.</p> <p>“One of the main things that came out quite strongly was links between pesticide exposure and reproductive issues,” said Macpherson. “We saw quite strong links – correlation and causation – for miscarriage and people basically struggling to conceive.”</p> <p>The DSV research adds to previous <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/sep/23/earth-breach-planetary-boundaries-health-check-oceans"">findings by the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research</a> that we have already far exceeded the safe planetary boundary for environmental pollutants, including plastics. On Sunday, another report warned that the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/aug/03/world-in-15tn-plastics-crisis-hitting-health-from-infancy-to-old-age-report-warns"">world faces a “plastics crisis”</a>, which is causing disease and death from infancy to old age amid a huge acceleration of plastic production.</p> <p>The report also highlights critical shortcomings in current toxicity assessment, research and testing methods, exposing the ways in which existing checks and balances are failing to protect human and planetary health.</p> <p>“The way that we’ve generally done the testing has meant that we’ve missed a lot of effects,” Macpherson said. He singled out the assessment of endocrine-disrupting chemicals, which are substances that interfere with hormones, causing problems ranging from infertility to cancer. These have been found to confound the traditional assumption that lower doses will invariably have lesser effects.</p> <p>“One of the things is that when you have a chemical which is interfering with the endocrine system, it sometimes has a nonlinear response. So you’ll see that there’ll be a response at a very low dose, which you wouldn’t be able to predict from its behaviour at a high dose.”</p> <p>DSV describes itself as a “venture creator” that spins out companies aimed at tackling big problems in environmental and human health issues. Part of the purpose of the report is to identify problem areas that can be tackled by innovation.</p> <p>Currently, chemical toxicity as an environmental issue receives just a fraction of the funding that is devoted to climate change, a disproportionality that Macpherson says should change. “We obviously don’t want less funding going into the climate and the atmosphere,” he said. “But this we think – really, proportionally – needs more attention.”</p> <p>However, there were features of the problem that mean it lends itself more easily to solutions. “The good thing is that this can be potentially quite easily consumer-driven if people start to worry about things they’re personally buying,” Macpherson said.</p> <p>“There isn’t necessarily the need for a massive collective action; it can just be demand for safer products, because people want safer products.”</p> <p>For his part, since starting the research, Macpherson is careful about what touches his food. He cooks with a cast-iron skillet. He especially avoids heating food in plastic.</p> <p>“Unfortunately, it is a recommendation to eat more organic food, but it is more expensive in general. So at least washing fruit and vegetables before eating them, but organic if you can afford it.”</p>",news
Robin McKie gave prescient warnings about climate change,"<p>Robin McKie’s account of his 40&nbsp;years as the <em>Observer</em>’s science editor is as deeply absorbing as it is a warning to humanity (“<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/apr/13/what-ive-learned-after-40-years-as-the-observers-science-editor"">What I’ve learned after 40 years as the Observer’s science editor</a>”, Focus). He takes us back nearly 50&nbsp;years to British glaciologist John Mercer’s warning that continued use of fossil fuel could lead to a 2C temperature rise by the mid-21st century threatening, among other potential catastrophes, a 5m sea level rise. </p> <p>His warnings, since echoed by swelling numbers of scientists, point out that climate change “threatens to displace hundreds of millions of people from their homelands”. Tragically, McKie reports, “large parts of society turn their heads and deliberately reject the truths that have been presented to them”. Our increasingly busy roads and airports illustrate this. His article needs to be read by government ministers, reported widely in the press and studied in schools.<br><strong>Richard Vernon</strong><br>Oxford</p> <p>Everything on Earth is thermally driven, the warmer it gets the more dangerously active it becomes.

He had the “decent end of life care” that Sonia argues should be the gold standard: he had palliative care from hospitals, district and Macmillan nurses.

He also hated the inevitable loss of dignity in his last few weeks. </p> <p>I helped to provide the loving care until his last day, which, as Sodha rightly acknowledges, is a privilege that many relatives and friends cherish. But the dying have rights too and their wishes, should they want to shorten that period of their suffering, deserve respect and should be paramount. This bill is for Bob – who didn’t have the option of assisted dying – and one day, perhaps for me too. Yes, there have been safeguarding failures and NHS scandals.

Why Australia’s most prominent climate change deniers have stopped talking about the climate,"<p>The only regular meeting of Australia’s Saltbush Club takes place most Thursday evenings at a golf club in Five Dock, in Sydney’s inner west. The group’s founding members – a collection of the country’s most prominent and avid global heating deniers – include Gina Rinehart, the former Queensland premier Campbell Newman, former Business Council of Australia head Hugh Morgan, and Coalition MP Colin Boyce.</p> <p>At Five Dock, the crowd is mostly old and <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=1877545559172962&amp;set=a.1877545222506329.1073741844.1649056592021861"">mostly white</a>. They sometimes host contrarian speakers. But about six years ago, this gathering of climate sceptics decided to stop talking publicly about the climate.</p> <p>“We resolved to temporarily pivot from the climate debate and launch the Energy Realists of Australia to talk to people about matters that really concern them, like the price and security of power, instead of science,” said Rafe Champion, another Saltbush founder and a stalwart of the Five Dock meetup.</p> <p>The idea, Champion <a href=""https://rafechampion.substack.com/p/can-we-have-a-climate-science-debate?triedRedirect=true"">wrote on his blog</a> last month, was to target people using “evidence that they can understand, unlike the finer points of climate science”.</p> <p>As Australia heads to a federal election, the results of that pivot have been writ large in the campaign. Both major parties notionally support the net zero emissions target.

In recent years the Nationals vote has crashed, while the Greens have come into contention with growing support around Byron shire.</p> <p>The Nationals candidate, Kimberly Hone, told Sky News a few months ago her strategy was to stop the flow of Greens preferences electing Labor.</p> <p>“We’ve got to make sure that we hinder that and we drop [the Greens] vote,” she said<strong>.</strong></p> <p>In 2023, Hone – whose old <a href=""https://x.com/kimberly_hone/status/996746404700733440"">Twitter account</a> includes links to articles suggesting temperature increases are a religious “blessing” – started a new venture called the Richmond Energy Forum, which hosted anti-renewables speakers in front of banners claiming wind turbines were “killing koalas”.</p> <p>A few days later, Hone met Neil Killion – a Saltbush Club member and the organiser of the Gold Coast-based Climate and Energy Realists of Queensland – to discuss “cross-border team work on affordable and reliable energy”.</p> <p>Hone posted a <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/profile/100005354018451/search/?q=Neil"">photograph of their meeting</a> on her private Facebook page.</p> <p>The next month, Killion spoke at a meeting in which he discussed the beginnings of a “national network” that would include old school climate deniers, anti-renewables campaigners and the remnants of the post-Covid freedom movement.</p> <p>Tuned into the live feed were the moderator of the Facebook group “Australian Climate Skeptics”; Graham Young, the former Queensland Liberal vice-president and head of the Australian Institute for Progress; and Viv Forbes, the executive director of the Saltbush Club and a former coal mining executive who served as an ambassador for an <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/26/co2-is-plant-food-australian-group-signs-international-declaration-denying-climate-science"">international declaration claiming “there is no climate emergency”</a> and that “CO2 is plant food”.</p> <p>“A lot of the people in the freedom movement as a whole would be supportive of what we do,” Killion told those on the video call.</p> <p>“All told it’s pretty impressive. All of us basically feel the same way, so this is, if you will, the first step in making this [national network] a reality.”</p> <p>Later at the same meeting, Boyce said <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/apr/16/coalition-mp-colin-boyce-told-climate-science-deniers-blackouts-a-big-political-opportunity"">blackouts were “a big political opportunity”</a> and that he had urged fellow MPs to adopt a “do-nothing strategy” that would allow power outages and build opposition to net zero policies.</p> <p>Paul Williams, an associate professor in politics and journalism at Griffith University, says the climate wars are still “a salient issue among conservative or reactionary voters, particularly in the regions”.</p> <p>But Williams says the primary issues for voters at the election are the cost of living and health.</p> <p>“[The Coalition] will try to bring over working-class people … by cultivating a culture war.

Tripp’s questions included asking panellists how we “combat the story, or the lie, that is being told to our younger generation that the world is coming to an end due to climate change”.</p> <p>Tripp also asked: “Donald Trump has abandoned the Paris agreement, why won’t the Coalition?”</p> <p>The Queensland Nationals senator Matt Canavan told the audience the 2020 election of Joe Biden (and Trump’s loss) had been key to the Coalition signing up to net zero emissions targets.</p> <p>“It’s hard for me to answer why. Obviously I’ve taken a position against net zero and I did that long before Donald Trump was re-elected,” Canavan said.</p> <p>“When we did sign up to net zero … [former prime minister] Scott Morrison told us we had to do that because Joe Biden was elected and he wanted to do it, which was strange to me because there were a lot of allegations of voting irregularities at that election … I can’t remember anyone saying that Australians voted.</p> <p>“It really perplexes me that, hang on, shouldn’t we get to decide on that? We haven’t actually had an election to decide on whether we should support net zero. There hasn’t been a battle. We never asked. Both sides of politics signed up to it.</p> <p>“It would be nice to have that political battle; I keep pushing for that.”</p> <p>The Coalition campaign did not respond to questions, including about potential agitation from MPs to drop its net zero commitment, in line with Trump’s America.</p> <p>Hone did not respond.</p> <p>Those behind the Saltbush Club say the political tide turning in the US offers hope for an about-face in Australia, too.</p> <p>“So far there is not much to show for our efforts but events are starting to move very quickly in the United States,” Champion wrote on his blog.</p> <p>“We expect this will help us after the forthcoming national election when climate and energy realists in the Liberal party can speak freely.</p> <p>“In the meantime, the pink and green rats in the Liberal ranks maintain their stranglehold on policy because polling indicates the people are not ready to be told the truth about climate and energy issues.” </p>",news
Helm by Sarah Hall review – a mighty epic of climate change in slow motion,"<p>Even if Sarah Hall did not begin her acknowledgments by saying that it’s taken her 20 years to write Helm it would be evident. Not from a cursory glance at her bibliography, perhaps: in that time Hall has published six other novels and three volumes of extraordinary short stories. But in every other way, and the moment you begin reading.</p> <p>There’s the subject, for starters. Ever since the first paragraph of her first novel, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/jun/15/featuresreviews.guardianreview26"">Haweswater</a>, in which an early 20th-century man drives his horse and cart through the waters of a Cumbrian valley recently drowned by a dam, Hall has been concerned with landscape, with weather, with nature in all its forms, with the ways in which we affect each other. In <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2017/jan/03/the-carhullan-army-a-near-future-struggle-that-feels-all-too-close"">The Carhullan Army</a>, climate change has already happened. Cumbria is semi-tropical, temperate England a folk memory; a dystopian vision that feels, this baked summer, uncomfortably close to reality. <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/01/the-wolf-border-by-sarah-hall-review"">The Wolf Border</a>, published in 2015, was, among many other things, about the ethics and unpredictabilities of rewilding an apex predator, while Hall’s last novel, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/oct/08/burntcoat-by-sarah-hall-review-love-under-lockdown"">Burntcoat</a>, written in the first lockdown, was set in and after a pandemic. Her story Later, His Ghost is set in a perpetual windstorm of total climate breakdown; in One in Four, a virologist writes to his wife, apologising for getting things wrong. In this new novel, weather and climate are not just potent settings but the main event. The central character in Helm is the Helm, Britain’s only named wind.</p> <p>This wind, which is local to Cumbria, occurs when air sweeping down Cross Fell, above the Eden valley, creates both a <a href=""https://weather.metoffice.gov.uk/learn-about/weather/types-of-weather/wind/helm-wind"">crest and a low bar of cloud</a>. “Tricky to explain/visualise”, admits Helm. “For now, imagine a skater launching off a quarter pipe two thousand feet high, then somersaulting. Again. And again and again.” As the book begins, Helm witnesses its own arrival. An ice age, sun flares, ash cloud; and, relatively insignificant in the context of such deep time, the evolution of humanity. Because there are many people in the novel, too, which is structured by braiding their stories with Helm’s, but also with lists: the forces of Helm, for instance, which range from “0. Zero Helm (complete calm). Mean wind speed &lt; 1mph. Weathervanes and trees unmoving, grass still, water as mirror, smoke rising vertically from roundhouses/cottages/plague pyres” to “12. Hurricane Helm (Hand of God). Wind speed 73-83mph, phenomenal damage and widescale loss of life, Eden reconfigured biblically, Carlisle-Settle train lifted off the tracks, history made, FIN.”</p> <p>Other lists include names for Helm and the damage Helm can wreak; or the trinkets Helm collects, often after that damage (Howdah pistol, iron skullcap, Apple iPhone 11 64GB, Tornado F3 series, eject pin). The pictures humans make, trying to understand, locate, corral Helm. Helm finds people amusing, and watches as they succeed each other; Hall’s ambition may be bounded by one valley, but it reaches through thousands of years. Her subjects range from a neolithic tribe to a medieval exorcist; from an isolated 18th-century wife to a quixotic Victorian meteorologist; from a wind-touched, lonely mid-20th-century child to a present-day academic counting plastic particles in the air. From stone tools to the Industrial Revolution to the advent of AI, each era has its own existential encounters with Helm: as deity or devil, as a psychological or a scientific mystery. Both sides are made complacent by Helm’s longevity, size and power, by human smallness and briefness, neither realising, until perhaps too late, that these little beings threaten Helm’s own existence.</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>We move from a neolithic world interpreted through animal behaviour to the bathos of the 21st century</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A project of this scope, which requires a range of research and imagination that could have produced several historical novels, not to mention an entire other volume of meteorological expertise, holds so much in suspension around its whirling, windy core that it could easily blow apart. But, despite the occasional threat or lull, Helm doesn’t. Partly, I would argue, this is because of Hall’s development as a consummate short story writer. Her novels are never less than hugely accomplished, but the narrative demands of the longer form, especially in more conventional earlier work, can sometimes dissipate the blaze of which she is capable. Hall is freed by the constraints of the short story – like the female sculptor in her last novel, Burntcoat, she burns away everything extraneous – and her work only gains in concentrated, suggestive power. Each strand of Helm has this concentration; the characters and voices could stand alone, but they flow together into something deep and rich, held together by the Eden valley, and its Helm.</p> <p>And by the writing. Hall’s work on place, and especially this corner of England, has always been virtuosic, a tough and supple poetry anchored in decades of attention to Cumbrian land and plants and skies. In her first novels it sometimes threatened to submerge everything else, but in Helm is so embedded on the page that it’s easy to take for granted, until you pause and back up to really look at the “dirty, clay-slipped sky”, or a gaggle of Victorian children, born into the shantytown that grows up around the railway, collecting on a hillside to eat magic mushrooms and stare at the “silly jinking stars”.</p> <p>Every era in Helm has its own seeing; the same land, the same wind filtered through time-specific fears and hopes and work, time-specific knowings, from a neolithic world interpreted through animal behaviour to the bathos of 21st-century cycling waterproofs, pub menus, emails. Hall has a thrilling command of vocabulary, with the concurrent deployment of etymologies and the hinterlands they bring; words often work not as single notes, but as chords, big ideas slipping in on the wakes of concrete specificities. So NaNay, a neolithic girl, watches as the wind approaches: “In the centre it was blue-grey, like bull-hide, with the dull pearl-shine of scales at its edges. It was faceless and its body was its only government.” The “spectral gap” is a technical term of modern mathematics and quantum mechanics as well as meteorology. But what heft and metaphorical possibility such a gap has, when a retired policeman in a glider is required to fly into it.</p> <p>Above all it is the wind itself that holds this vastly ambitious, serious – but also often playful and ironic – book together. Some might find Helm’s voice initially a little arch, a little unplaced relative to the human voices, but it grows on you. Antic, needy, angry, curious, millennia-old Helm, who gives and takes, fascinates and awes, is feared and loved, and loves in return; who absorbs violences, propitiations, yearnings, and who is now beginning to feel “a bit wrong”. There has been so much change, over so many millennia, but this is different. “It’s complicated. Hard to put Helm’s fingers on it.” It isn’t that Helm is old, more that “Whatever is wrong … feels insidious, sneaky, infectious. The surprise disease on the routine tests. Some kind of weird intimate growth you find accidentally and go, Jesus, how long has that been there? A toxic waft when you’re asleep. Lights out.”</p> <p>The neolithic tribe listens to Helm in its prime, “splintering and shredding the valley, its voice mourning its own violence”. In the mid-20th century Helm searches for a young girl, his friend, who has been locked in an asylum, and, trying to look beyond the valley, “rises, higher, until being is difficult”. At the 21st-century meteorological observation post, 2,000ft up, Helm whips and churns and “calls to awful prayer”. A prayer for itself, perhaps, because whatever Hall’s intentions – an urgent rallying, a tribute, a warning – this novel reads like nothing so much as an elegy.</p> <p>• Helm by Sarah Hall is published by Faber (£20).

"Climate change target of 2C is ‘dead’, says renowned climate scientist","<p>The pace of global heating has been significantly underestimated, according to renowned climate scientist Prof James Hansen, who said the international 2C target is “dead”.</p> <p>A new analysis by Hansen and colleagues concludes that both the impact of recent cuts in sun-blocking shipping pollution, which has raised temperatures, and the sensitivity of the climate to increasing fossil fuels emissions are greater than thought.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/feb/04/temperatures-at-north-pole-20c-above-average-and-beyond-ice-melting-point"">Temperatures at north pole 20C above average and beyond ice melting point</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The group’s results are at the high end of estimates from mainstream climate science but cannot be ruled out, independent experts said. If correct, they mean even worse extreme weather will come sooner and there is a greater risk of passing global tipping points, such as the collapse of the critical Atlantic ocean currents.</p> <p>Hansen, at Columbia University in the US, sounded the alarm to the general public about climate breakdown in <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/19/james-hansen-nasa-scientist-climate-change-warning"">testimony he gave to a UN congressional committee</a> in 1988.</p> <p>“The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPPC) defined a scenario which gives a 50% chance to keep warming under 2C – that scenario is now impossible,” he said. “The 2C target is dead, because the global energy use is rising, and it will continue to rise.” </p> <p>The new analysis said global heating is likely to reach 2C by 2045, unless solar geoengineering is deployed.</p> <p>The world’s nations pledged in Paris in 2015 to keep global temperature rise below 2C above preindustrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5C. The climate crisis has already <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/18/climate-crisis-to-blame-for-dozens-of-impossible-heatwaves-studies-reveal"">supercharged extreme weather across the world</a> with just 1.3C of heating on average in recent years destroying lives and livelihoods – 2C would be far worse.</p> <p>Prof Jeffrey Sachs, also at Columbia University, said: “A shocking rise of warming has been exposed by, ironically, a reduction of pollutants, but we now have a new baseline and trajectory for where we are.”</p> <p>Climate scientist <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/zeke-hausfather-7327699/"">Dr Zeke Hausfather</a>, who was not part of the study, said it was a useful contribution. “It’s important to emphasise that both of these issues – [pollution cuts] and climate sensitivity – are areas of deep scientific uncertainty,” he said. </p> <p>“While Hansen et al are on the high end of available estimates, we cannot say with any confidence that they are wrong, rather that they just represent something closer to a worst-case outcome.”</p> <p>In the new study, <a href=""https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00139157.2025.2434494"">published in the journal Environment: Science and Policy for Sustainable Development</a>, Hansen’s team said: “Failure to be realistic in climate assessment and failure to call out the fecklessness of current policies to stem global warming is not helpful to young people.” </p> <p>They said the IPCC analysis was heavily reliant on computer models and that the complementary approach they took of making more use of observations and climate analogues from the distant past was needed.</p> <p>The world has seen <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jan/10/world-temperature-in-2024-exceeded-15c-for-first-time"">extraordinary temperatures over the last two years</a>. The primary cause is the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/13/no-sign-of-promised-fossil-fuel-transition-as-emissions-hit-new-high"">relentless rise</a> in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from the burning of fossil fuels. The peak of the El Niño climate cycle in 2024 added an extra temperature boost.</p> <p>However, these two factors do not fully explain the extreme temperatures, or their persistence after the El Niño ended in mid-2024. This left <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00816-z"">puzzled climate scientists</a> asking if there was a worrying new factor not previously accounted for, or if the extra heat was an unusual but temporary natural variation.</p> <p>A key focus has been on emissions from shipping. For decades, the sulphate particles produced by ships burning fuel have blocked some sunlight from reaching the Earth’s surface, suppressing temperatures. </p> <p>But in 2020, new anti-pollution regulations came into force, sharply cutting the level of the aerosol particles. This led to <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/may/30/termination-shock-cut-in-ship-pollution-sparked-global-heating-spurt"">more heat from the sun reaching the surface</a>, which scientists measure as watts per square metre (W/m2).</p> <p>Hansen’s team’s estimate of the impact of this – 0.5W/m2 – is significantly higher than five other recent studies, which ranged from 0.07 to 0.15 W/m2, but would explain the anomalous heat. Hansen’s team used a top-down approach, looking at the change in the reflectivity over key parts of the ocean and ascribing that to the reductions in shipping emissions. The other studies used bottom-up approaches to estimate the increase in heat.</p> <p>“Both approaches are useful and often complementary,” said Dr Gavin Schmidt, director of Nasa’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies. “But I think in this case, Hansen’s approach is too simple and doesn’t factor in changes in Chinese emissions, or internal variability.”</p> <p>The new study also argues that the planet’s climate sensitivity to rising carbon emissions has been underestimated, partly because of the underestimation of the impact of reduced shipping emissions. </p> <p>Climate sensitivity is defined by scientists as the temperature rise that would result from a doubling of CO<sub>2</sub> levels in the atmosphere. Again, Hansen’s team have used a different method to most scientists and come up with a higher estimate.</p> <p>The IPCC, a collaboration of the world’s climate scientists, found that the computer models that best reproduce past temperatures have a climate sensitivity of 2.5C to 4C. </p> <p>Hansen’s team took a simpler approach, calculating the potential range in temperature rises for a doubling of CO<sub>2</sub> and then using data on how much heat the Earth has trapped to estimate the most likely climate sensitivity. Their estimate is 4.5C. <a href=""https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adq7280"">Cloud formation</a>, which is affected by global heating and aerosol pollution, is a key source of the uncertainties.</p> <p>Anomalously <a href=""https://www.theclimatebrink.com/p/january-sets-an-unexpected-temperature"">high temperatures have continued in January 2025</a>, which set a new record for the month and confounded expectations that temperatures would drop with the current La Niña, the cooler part of the El Niño cycle. “This unexpected record may presage higher temperatures this year than many of us thought,” said Hausfather.</p> <p>Hansen’s group also argues that the accelerated global heating they predict will increase ice melting in the Arctic. </p> <p>“As a result, shutdown of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (Amoc) is likely within the next 20-30 years, unless actions are taken to reduce global warming – in contradiction to conclusions of IPCC. </p> <p>“If Amoc is allowed to shut down, it will lock in major problems including sea level rise of several metres – thus, we describe Amoc shutdown as the ‘point of no return’.” </p> <p>The central estimate of another recent study on the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/25/gulf-stream-could-collapse-as-early-as-2025-study-suggests"">timing of an Amoc collapse</a> was 2050.</p> <p>However, Hansen said the point of no return could be avoided, based on the growing conviction of young people that they should follow the science. He called for a carbon fee and dividend policy, where all fossil fuels are taxed and the revenue returned to the public. </p> <p>“The basic problem is that the waste products of fossil fuels are still dumped in the air free of charge,” he said. He also backed the rapid development of nuclear power.</p> <p>Hansen also supported research on cooling the Earth using controversial geoengineering techniques to block sunlight, which he prefers to call “purposeful global cooling”.</p> <p>He said: “We do not recommend implementing climate interventions, but we suggest that young people not be prohibited from having knowledge of the potential and limitations of purposeful global cooling in their toolbox.”</p> <p>Political change is needed to achieve all these measures, Hansen said: “Special interests have assumed far too much power in our political systems. In democratic countries the power should be with the voter, not with the people who have the money. That requires fixing some of our democracies, including the US.”</p>",news
"Flavour of gin and tonic could be impacted by climate change, study finds","<p>The flavour of a gin and tonic may be impacted by climate change, scientists have found.</p> <p>Volatile weather patterns, made more likely by climate breakdown, could change the taste of juniper berries, which are the key botanical that give gin its distinctive taste.</p> <p>Scientists from Heriot-Watt University’s International Centre for Brewing and Distilling (ICBD) have found that changing weather patterns may be altering the flavour compounds in the berries.</p> <p>The berries have their own regional “terroir” just like wine, depending on rainfall and sunshine, according to the findings, which have been published in the <a href=""https://jib.cibd.org.uk/index.php/jib/article/view/72"">Journal of the Institute of Brewing</a>.</p> <p>Matthew Pauley, an assistant professor at the ICBD, said: “A wet harvest year can reduce the total volatile compounds in juniper by about 12% compared to a dry year.</p>    <p>“This has direct implications for the sensory characteristics that make gin taste like gin.”</p> <p>Scientists distilled juniper berries from different regions across Europe including Albania, Bosnia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, Kosovo and Italy, as well as from varying harvest years. They analysed the resulting spirits using gas chromatography to measure the levels of key flavour compounds.</p> <p>They found that berries from each region had distinct chemical profiles, and the differences could impact the woody, resinous, citrus and floral notes in the gin.</p> <p>The amount of rainfall in a given year significantly impacted the flavour of the berries. Wetter weather meant longer drying periods for the berries were needed, which changed the abundance of water-soluble chemicals in the berries.</p> <p>Prof Annie Hill, the study’s supervisor, said: “The least water-soluble compounds are most affected by post-harvest drying.</p> <p>“For distillers, this means the flavour profile can shift depending on the harvest conditions.</p> <p>“For a multibillion-pound industry, which is increasingly focused on consistency and quality for its discerning consumers, this represents a risk.”</p> <p>Premium gin producers carefully select their berries from certain regions to maintain a distinctive taste and house style, but this may be disrupted by climate patterns changing, and some areas getting more rainfall than others.</p>",news
"Dying satellites can drive climate change and ozone depletion, study finds","<p>Right now there are more than 9,000 satellites circumnavigating overhead, keeping track of weather, facilitating communications, aiding navigation and monitoring the Earth. By 2040, there could be more than 60,000. A new study shows that the emissions from expired satellites, as they fall to Earth and burn up, will be significant in future years, with implications for ozone hole recovery and climate.</p> <p>Satellites need to be replaced after about five years. Most old satellites are disposed of by reducing their altitude and letting them burn up as they fall, releasing pollution into Earth’s atmosphere such as aerosolised aluminium. To understand the impact of these growing emissions from expired satellites, researchers simulated the effects associated with an annual release of 10,000 tonnes of aluminium oxide by 2040 (the amount estimated to be released from disposal of 3,000 satellites a year, assuming a fleet of 60,000 satellites).</p> <p>The results, which are published in <a href=""https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024JD042442"">Journal of Geophysical Research Atmospheres</a>, show that the re-entry material will accumulate at high latitudes and could result in temperature anomalies of up to 1.5C in the middle to upper atmosphere, reduction of wind speeds and ozone depletion, which could jeopardise ozone hole recovery. Other metals including titanium, lithium, iron and copper will also be released and their impact is yet to be modelled.</p>",news

Heather Ferguson, professor of infectious disease ecology at the University of Glasgow, who leads the Mosquito Scotland project,<strong> </strong>says the “absolute number one priority” for the UK government if it wants to protect UK citizens long-term is to invest in measures to control these diseases in the tropical countries where they cause the overwhelming burden of illness and death.</p> <p>She added: “We should never lose sight of the fact that one child under five dies of malaria approximately every minute, with approximately 600,000 deaths and over 100 million cases in 2023 alone.</p> <p>“As we learned from the pandemic, infectious diseases have no borders and can spread quickly when the conditions are right. The government’s cuts to foreign aid will lead to a collapse in crucial surveillance, control and treatment programmes in endemic countries, causing more deaths from tropical disease.</p> <p>“The best way to defend ourselves is to not only maintain, but strengthen investment into the global elimination efforts that will ultimately keep all of us safe from tropical disease.”</p> <p>Solomon said: “Controlling mosquito-borne diseases overseas is also an important element of protecting the UK. If they are controlled overseas, there is less chance of them spreading to the UK.”</p> <p>“Long-term policies that address net zero challenges globally are arguably the best protection against such diseases,” said Prof James Wood, the infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Cambridge and the co-director of Cambridge Infectious Diseases.</p> <p>A FCDO spokesperson said: “Global health security is essential for our national security and the UK is a leading donor in the fight against mosquito-borne tropical diseases. We play a major role in the global malaria response, and we are the third largest donor to the global fund.</p> <p>“This week we adopted a new pandemic agreement, which will improve the way countries around the world work together to detect and combat global health threats. As the minister for international development, Baroness Chapman, has said, global health will be a priority for the UK’s international development. Diseases cross borders so our diplomacy must too.”</p>",news
Hurricane-hit Grenadians see climate change and reparations as one struggle,"<p>When category 4 Hurricane Beryl <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jul/05/hurricane-beryl-causes-devastation-across-caribbean"">hit the Caribbean last June</a>, the three-island nation of <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/grenada"">Grenada</a> bore the brunt of its wrath. At the time, the country’s prime minister, Dickon Mitchell, described the destruction as “almost Armageddon-like”. On the small island of <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/03/grenada-carriacou-caribbean-climate-victims-icj"">Carriacou</a>, it was estimated by officials that more than 90% of the buildings were damaged or destroyed. Agriculture and infrastructure for electricity and communication were almost completely wiped out.</p> <p>Nearly a year on, there are some signs of recovery and rebuilding, but hollowed-out buildings, roofless houses and charred, dying mangroves tell the story of a community that is still coming to grips with the devastation.</p> <p>Some people are still living in tents. Artists Michael Alexander and Yolanda VendenDunden pitched theirs on the foundations of one of the many houses demolished by the hurricane.</p> <p>VendenDunden had just moved to the island from the Netherlands when authorities announced Beryl was coming. The artists say the hurricane was much worse than they expected.</p>    <p>“The roof started to shake, and the walls caved in. Yolanda passed out,” said Alexander.</p> <p>They survived, but they lost their home and many of their possessions. Suddenly homeless, they decided to live in the tent, with a makeshift bathroom and kitchen beside it. “I built up back the kitchen and bathroom from the pieces of the house and blocked it off so the lady could get privacy. And we sleep in the tent,” said Alexander.</p> <p>The tent gives them some privacy, but it gives them no refuge from the oppressive heat. And local farmers say that heat is causing droughts which are worse every year. </p> <p>Gifford Andrew, a farmer on Carriacou, said the combination of hurricanes and water shortages makes farming extremely challenging.</p>    <p>“I lost everything in Beryl. Now I’m trying to put the pieces back together, but I have to deal with the drought. Every single year it’s worse, and it means a lot more water is needed to water my plot. It’s really hard,” he said.</p> <p>The triple whammy of hurricanes, drought and coastal erosion makes the island one of the starkest examples of <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-crisis"">climate crisis</a> challenges, said the Carriacou government official and environmentalist Davon Baker. “The impact of climate change has been pretty severe. In addition to hurricanes, we are losing a lot of beach space to rising sea levels, and we are having extreme and intense dry seasons, which affect our farming and ability to produce food,” he said.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/mar/25/seaweed-caribbean-grenada-sargassum-biotechnology-energy-climate-crisis-ocean"">From foul to fuel: how a seaweed problem could power the Caribbean</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the face of these serious and multiple climate crisis-related threats, Grenada’s prime minister has been advocating for more support from rich countries, which he said had built their wealth by polluting the planet. Grenada last year joined other vulnerable countries in <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/03/grenada-carriacou-caribbean-climate-victims-icj"">a landmark case at the international court of justice</a> which seeks to hold polluting countries accountable for their roles in the climate crisis.</p> <p>At the same time as that push for climate accountability, Caribbean leaders have been stepping up their pursuit of reparatory justice over the centuries-long transatlantic slave trade, which saw more than 12.5 million Africans kidnapped, forcibly transported to the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/americas"">Americas</a> and sold into slavery. They argue that enslavement and colonisation are still having detrimental impacts on their countries’ social and economic development.</p> <p>Now some in the reparations movement are arguing that the two efforts are part of the same struggle. Arley Gill, the head of the Grenada Reparations Commission, has pointed said there was an “inescapable” link between the pursuit of justice for enslavement and justice for climate change.</p>    <p>Gill argues that the Industrial Revolution is linked to both slavery and the climate crisis and that the Caribbean’s underdevelopment – itself a legacy of colonialism and enslavement – hampers the region’s ability to deal with the effects of the climate crisis.</p> <p>“Our climate change challenges can be traced to the Industrial Revolution. And the Industrial Revolution in Europe was fueled by the Atlantic slave trade and slavery. Black people were enslaved in the Caribbean to export cotton and sugar. These raw materials – which were then refined in the factories in Europe and consumed in Europe and sold all over the world – came from the very crimes of humanity which we speak of and for which we claim reparative justice. So that there is an inevitable link between reparative justice and climate change.”</p>    <p>He added: “More than that, the harm which was caused by the Atlantic slave trade and slavery created a vulnerable environment in the Caribbean. In other words, we lack the resources to address the effects of climate change – and the reason we lack the resources is partly or mostly due to underdevelopment, which was caused by the Atlantic slave trade.”</p> <p>For people in Carriacou who are suffering the ill effects of the climate crisis, the issue has become a matter of survival.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/03/grenada-carriacou-caribbean-climate-victims-icj"">On the Grenadian island of Carriacou, even the dead are now climate victims</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sitting in his office in Carriacou, Tevin Andrews, the minister for Carriacou and Petite Martinique, described how he lost a close friend to Beryl.</p> <p>The island, he said, was surviving on hopes and prayers.</p> <p>“Every single year from July to December, we have to, as we say it in the Caribbean, <strong>‘</strong>ban our belly’ and pray to our God, hoping that nothing strikes us. So we know, first-hand, the experience of climate change, the rising temperature, the rise in sea levels and the devastation that is caused by hurricanes,” he said.</p> <p>Criticising the slow pace of action on the climate crisis and reparations, Andrews said rich countries “built their wealth on our backs, from our hard work and left us high and dry with no infrastructure, with no educational infrastructure”.</p> <p>The lack of engagement and action by richer countries and former colonisers “sends a clear message that really and truly they don’t care about us”, he said.</p> <p>“Their actions have us where we are.

‘Like touching climate change’: glaciers reveal records of the way the world was,"<p>Howling wind relentlessly shakes the white tent, pitched among mounds of snow at a height of 4,100m (13,450ft) on the Corbassière, an Alpine glacier situated on the northern slopes of Switzerland’s Grand Combin massif.</p> <p>Inside are scientists from Venice’s Ca’ Foscari University and the institute of polar science at Italy’s national research council (CNR).</p>    <p>They are camping here for 12 days, braving harsh conditions in freezing temperatures as low as -20C (-4F) as they work day and night to operate machinery that is drilling deep into the rapidly melting glacier.</p> <p>Their mission is to salvage the Corbassière’s remaining ice and unlock the precious trove of knowledge it holds about past climates before global heating completely wipes the glacier out.</p>    <p>The scientists do this by drilling a borehole and extracting long, cylinder-shaped ice cores. These are essentially centuries-old libraries containing records of preindustrial greenhouse gases, pollutants, pollen and bacteria that provide information about historic temperatures and the impact humans have had on the changing environment.</p> <p>The deeper they manage to drill, the greater the potential for older ice and its rich archive to emerge. An <a href=""https://www.cnr.it/it/nota-stampa/n-10353"">expedition on the Grenz glacier</a> on Monte Rosa in 2021 yielded ice cores containing climate information dating back over the last 10,000 years, including pollutants from the Roman era.</p>    <p>“A glacier is like a book made up of many pages,” said Jacopo Gabrieli, a glaciologist at CNR. “The pages are layers of ice, with the first few already unreadable because of the melt. It’s like throwing a glass of water on an old manuscript and watching the ink quickly disappear. We know the deepest layers are still readable because it is cold enough. But it is an absolute race against time.”</p> <p>The Corbassière drilling expedition is the first of three planned by Follow the Ice, a scientific and educational project supported by <a href=""https://www.pradagroup.com/it/sustainability/cultural-csr/sea-beyond.html"">Sea Beyond</a>, an initiative led by the Prada Group. A week into the expedition, the team of 13, which includes mountain guides, a videographer and a nurse who doubles as a cook, welcomed a small group of journalists who were brought to base-camp by helicopter.</p> <p>The team extracted two ice cores from the glacier, although they won’t know the secrets they hold until analysis is done.</p> <p>Along with greenhouse gases, previous glacier drills have enabled scientists to study cores for the DNA of ancient viruses that could resurface amid global heating, along with frozen insects and plants that could give insight into the history of forests and their ecosystems.</p>    <p>The mission on the Corbassière, backed by the Ice Memory, a nonprofit organisation aimed at preserving and analysing ice cores from the world’s most at-risk glaciers, is incredibly daring.</p> <p>For the first few days, the squad had to adapt to the altitude, many struggling to breathe or suffering headaches and nausea. Sleep has been scant, with hours spent clearing snow out of tents and away from pathways.</p> <p>Unexpected changes in weather have stalled progress, as did the sudden breakage of a cable powering the drill. Victor Zagorodnov, a scientist who, at 75, is the oldest on the team, said: “Constant signs of danger play with your mind, but you have to resist.” </p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/may/29/almost-40-of-worlds-glaciers-already-doomed-due-to-climate-crisis-study"">Almost 40% of world’s glaciers already doomed due to climate crisis – study</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Zagorodnov has been leading drilling expeditions on glaciers around the world since the 1980s. “The first time was in Bolivia,” he said. “The mind is telling you it’s dangerous, and to leave. It causes nightmares. But you persevere.”</p> <p>Zagorodnov, who is also a glacier-drilling technology specialist, compared the experience to “learning to ride a bike”. “You get used to it,” he said. “Plus, when I first started the equipment was basic, today it is much more advanced.”</p> <p>Gabrieli is more than used to witnessing the evidence of the climate crisis on glaciers. In 2020, during test drilling on the Corbassière, water was found at a 30m (98ft) depth. “We put our hands in the water,” he said. “It was like touching climate change.”</p> <p>Another thing that dismayed him during that visit was rain. “I didn’t think it was possible to have precipitation at this altitude,” he added. “It was only a small amount of rain but it was really depressing.”</p> <p>The experience made the team realise even more that they needed to act quickly, and so returned to finish the work.</p> <p>This time, the team came equipped with the more advanced electro-thermal drill, a device that penetrates glacier ice through melting. The thermal drill had reached about seven metres deep when a burning stench overwhelmed the scientists.</p> <p>“We thought something was wrong with the drill but then realised it had hit a plastic bag,” said Carlo Barbante, a professor at Ca’ Foscari who co-founded the Ice Memory Foundation. “It must have been left there by climbers years ago, and really proved the impact of human activity on the climate. Plastic is everywhere, pollution is everywhere. It is very disappointing.”</p> <p>After six days, the drill successfully reached a depth of 55m (180ft). But then the power cable breakage forced the team to revert to using an electromechanical drill.</p> <p>Still, the device helped them to finish the job, and by day nine they were euphoric after making a major breakthrough: the drill hit “bedrock” – the solid rock lying beneath the glacier – at a depth of 99.5m (326ft). The first of the two ice cores was extracted and transported down the mountain, and the second followed a week later.</p> <p>The ice cores will be dated and the plan is for one to be analysed in Italy, while the other will be shipped to Antarctica, where a cave is being excavated to store ice extracted through glacier drills, providing a library of information for future climate scientists.</p> <p>Apart from Europe, the Ice Memory foundation has so far drilled on glaciers in Bolivia and Russia. The missions are costly and intense, but crucial, said Barbante.</p> <p>“Glaciers, especially in non-polar regions, are very much at the forefront of global warming,” said Barbante. “They are water reservoirs for millions of people, so if the ice completely disappears there will be huge problems. We are are witnessing what is happening and it must be documented so we can leave something for future scientists. This is our duty.”</p>",news
Arctic plant study reveals an ‘early warning sign’ of climate change upheaval,"<p>Scientists studying <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/arctic"">Arctic</a> plants say the ecosystems that host life in some of the most inhospitable reaches of the planet are changing in unexpected ways in an “early warning sign” for a region upended by <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-crisis"">climate change</a>.</p> <p>In four decades, 54 researchers tracked more than 2,000 plant communities across 45 sites from the Canadian high Arctic to Alaska and Scandinavia. They discovered dramatic shifts in temperatures and growing seasons produced no clear winners or losers. Some regions witnessed large increases in shrubs and grasses and declines in flowering plants – which struggle to grow under the shade created by taller plants.</p> <p>Those findings, published in <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08946-8"">Nature</a>, fill key knowledge gaps for teams on the frontlines of a changing climate.</p> <p>“Climate change is so widespread across the whole of the Arctic and we’re seeing this magnitude of warming at four times the rate than the rest of the planet. We expected to see very concrete trends and trajectories. Because in other biomes, we are,” said lead author Mariana García Criado, a postdoctoral researcher in tundra biodiversity at the University of Edinburgh. “But the Arctic is a special and often unexpected place.”</p> <p>The researchers found greater species richness at lower latitudes and warmer sites, while species and the areas with the greatest growth – and loss – were in areas with the largest temperature increase.</p> <p>In <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/canada"">Canada’s</a> western Arctic, for example, Isla Myers-Smith and her “Team Shrub” group of researchers have documented ecosystems rapidly shifting, where the tundra is “greening” at an incredible rate as shrubs such as willow push north and grow taller.</p> <p>Shrubs are highly competitive: they grow taller and shade out other plants, extracting more resources in the process. As they take over, they push out the cottongrass, mosses and lichens that take hundreds – sometimes thousands – of years to grow. Higher temperatures and lengthened growing seasons mean this trend is unlikely to abate, and more broadly across the Arctic, the number and diversity of plants will keep growing.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/21/canada-arctic-herschel-island-qikiqtaruk-climate-permafrost-tundra-ecology-aoe"">‘The land is tearing itself apart’: life on a collapsing Arctic isle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Often when we think about climate change impacts on the planet we think about biodiversity loss, but in the temperature-limited tundra, climate change is multi-faceted,” she said in a news release.</p> <p>While an increase in <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/biodiversity"">biodiversity</a> might seem like a beneficial shift for the region, experts caution those changes come with a steep cost.</p> <p>“These ecosystems are so fragile and any changes to the species composition can really have strong effects on everything else. Changes start with plants, and if plants move, everything follows, said García Criado, adding that herds of caribou were among the most likely casualties, as bare spots on the tundra, favoured by the lichen that they like to eat, are overtaken by shrubs.</p> <p>“This has cascading effects for Arctic animals that depend on these plants, also for food security for all the people that live in the Arctic, for local and Indigenous communities, but also for the more ecosystem function,.”</p> <p>Greg Henry, a geography professor at the University of British Columbia who helped establish the study’s data collection system, said the research involved thousands of hours of fieldwork in remote locations, with teams “enduring extreme weather, clouds of biting insects and even the occasional polar bear encounter”.</p> <p>But researchers didn’t have enough data to include mosses and lichens in the study. These cryptogams are critical for ecosystem function, particularly in the Arctic where there is a rich diversity in species.</p> <p>García Criado said the results underscore the deep uncertainty in understanding the effects climate change has on life – and the way in which the Arctic often serves as a harbinger of changes to come.</p> <p>“All these changes that we’re observing, they’re not limited to the Arctic. We may see them in the Arctic, but the consequences spread far beyond the confines of the region,” she said. “We want to understand these changes. And then we need to prepare for these changes. Because it’s not a question of if they might happen – it is a question of when.”</p>",news
Uninsurable and unaffordable: climate change and the rising cost of housing,"<p>As housing affordability in Australia has worsened in recent years, it’s also brought the cost and challenges of adapting to climate change into sharp focus.</p> <p>More frequent and extreme weather events are already having an impact on housing, further reducing our stretched housing supply and contributing to increasing insurance costs. Climate change’s long-term impacts on mental health and economic resilience are also bubbling to the surface.</p> <p>The research sector is likely to play an important role as we attempt to tackle these dual crises, and researchers around Australia are working hard to understand how these problems relate to each other, and come up with solutions.</p> <p>To better understand the nature of the challenges and the research that is underway, we spoke with three housing and economic experts: Assoc Prof Ameeta Jain and Dr Hemant Pullabhotla from Deakin University, and Matthew Bowes from the Grattan Institute.</p> <h2>A problem of supply</h2> <p>Bowes, an associate with the Grattan Institute’s Housing and Economic Security Program, says Australia is facing both a home ownership and a rental crisis.</p> <p>While wages have been growing at about <a href=""https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/economy/price-indexes-and-inflation/wage-price-index-australia/latest-release#data-downloads"" rel=""nofollow"">4% a year</a>, rents in capital cities have been rising at about <a href=""https://www.abs.gov.au/articles/private-rent-inflation-capital-cities-vs-regions"" rel=""nofollow"">8% a year</a>, making it increasingly hard for renters to save a deposit to buy a home.</p> <p>“Clearly there is something wrong in the housing market when we are seeing both house prices and rents grow faster than people’s ability to pay for those housing costs,” Bowes says.</p> <p>But because the affordability crisis is being felt so acutely by many Australians, Bowes says policymakers are open to listening to researchers who present evidence-led solutions that can positively influence housing policy.</p> <p>Bowes argues that at the heart of the problem is a supply shortage and urban planning constraints that prevent the development of affordable, dense housing in desirable locations.

Can an AI chatbot of Dr Karl change climate sceptics’ minds? He’s willing to give it a try,"<p>There’s probably no face, voice or collection of exuberant, patterned shirts more recognisable than those belonging to Dr Karl Kruszelnicki.</p> <p>The bespectacled science communicator has been answering curly listener questions about science, with characteristic excitement and passion, for more than 40 years. Despite a seemingly tireless work ethic, Kruszelnicki, now 77 years old, can’t be everywhere all at once.</p> <p>Those questions now come in waves, across social media platforms at all hours of the day. “Sometimes, I get 300 requests a day on Twitter to answer an involved question about climate change,” Kruszelnicki says.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/sep/28/dr-karl-kruszelnicki-having-been-beaten-unconscious-really-changes-your-life"">Dr Karl Kruszelnicki: ‘Having been beaten unconscious really changes your life’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Particularly on X (formerly Twitter), he says he would often engage with users who don’t believe the climate crisis is real or urgent. He hoped there might be a way to change the minds of this group of people, who he says have been bombarded by misinformation in places such as the Murdoch press for the past 30 years.</p> <p>After speaking with longtime friend and technology journalist Leigh Stark, the pair settled on an idea: an AI-powered Digital Dr Karl. Using a large language model (LLM), they’re creating a chatbot designed to<strong> </strong>sound like Kruszelnicki that provides users with evidence, backed by trustworthy sources, that the climate crisis is caused by humans and is an urgent problem to solve.</p> <p>“I cannot answer all the questions by myself and people want questions answered. The only way I can do it is develop this digital AI,” he says.</p> <p>Kruszelnicki’s achievements as a science communicator are unparalleled: in Australia <a href=""https://www.sydney.edu.au/science/industry-and-community/community-engagement/dr-karl.html"">he’s considered a National Living Treasure</a>, he won the Unesco Kalinga prize, he wrote dozens of books and is the one and only Julius Sumner Miller Fellow at the University of Sydney, a position he has held since 1993.</p> <p>He believes AI can help convince those who don’t believe in the severity and causes of the climate crisis – even if there are outstanding questions around the ethical use of AI, its training data, accuracy and its own environmental impacts. “I think with climate change, we are at a stage where the perfect is the enemy of the good,” he says. “We’re certainly not going to become unethical or become like the forces of evil.”</p> <p>Digital Dr Karl runs on an open-source LLM developed by Mistral, a French company considered one of Europe’s challengers to OpenAI and Google.</p> <p>To create Digital Dr Karl, Stark has taken Mistral’s base model, then trained it on a corpus of Kruszelnicki’s climate science resources acquired through his own research for his own books and writing on climate. It includes academic papers, consensus statements and original articles from publications including the New York Times, the Guardian and RenewEconomy to build out its knowledge, just like the real Kruszelnicki has.</p> <p>“This is an AI that’s been trained on the 40,000 PDFs I’ve gathered over the last 40 years,” he says.</p> <p>Stark says questions over copyright are valid, and he would like to ultimately have the chatbot trained exclusively on data, but says “we’re not at that point yet”, emphasising “this is beta, this is really early stuff” and the intent is to build something “based solely on data”.</p> <h2>Putting Digital Dr Karl to the test</h2> <p>Taking the Guardian through a demonstration of Digital Dr Karl, Stark reveals the AI interface is similar to ChatGPT, and users can type in a single query about the climate crisis to kickstart a conversation.</p> <p>Stark types in “climate change is a hoax” and the Digital Dr Karl replies a few seconds later in a stilted and tonally inconsistent recreation of Kruszelnicki’s voice. It wants to know if we are suggesting the climate crisis “is a fabricated idea”. We are only able to answer yes or no.

Could a new wave of urgent theatre hold the key to tackling climate change?,"<p>Climate stories are typically defined by despair. The future we&nbsp;are told of is such a&nbsp;tragic, barren dystopia, it’s hard to look at head-on. But a flood of theatre-makers are&nbsp;writing their way past fear into something more useful, inspiring action through love, music, puppetry and folklore. “The ones who profit most from the idea that we’re doomed are the oil companies and the people massively polluting our planet,” reasons playwright Flora Wilson Brown. “If we allow ourselves to think there’s nothing we can do, we won’t do&nbsp;anything. There’s still time to act.”</p> <p>Wilson Brown rejects this nightmarish narrative in her play, <a href=""https://bristololdvic.org.uk/whats-on/the-beautiful-future-is-coming"">The&nbsp;Beautiful Future Is Coming</a>, at Bristol Old Vic. Exploring the impact of&nbsp;the climate crisis through the eyes of three couples, the play jumps between 1856, 2027 and 2100. In the scenes set in the past, life is returned to Eunice Foote, the real scientist who discovered the greenhouse effect years before the man who took credit for it; in the future, we visit the Svalbard seed vault, where humanity has stashed the ambition of life on another planet. “It’s about making the&nbsp;impact emotional,” Wilson Brown says, “rather than statistical.”</p> <p>In the timeline closest to the present day, The Beautiful Future Is Coming holds a mirror up, reminding us that we still have choice in our actions. “It’s easy to go: ‘I’m overwhelmed, I don’t know what I&nbsp;can&nbsp;do,’” says Nancy Medina, the show’s director and artistic director of&nbsp;Bristol Old Vic. “Actually, what you&nbsp;can do is care.” To nervously look&nbsp;away is a privilege, she says. “The&nbsp;majority of people being affected by the climate crisis, in the global south, don’t have the time or the energy to be scared of it. They are only just surviving it.” Through this lens, hope becomes an active, life-grabbing choice. A way of&nbsp;fighting for a future we can bear to look at.</p> <p>Stories have long been the way we share possibilities of a better world. During the research and development for <a href=""https://www.mayflower.org.uk/whats-on/bringing-the-outside-in-2025/"">Bringing the Outside In</a>, a show made by and for young people around Southampton and the New Forest, playwright Kit Miles learned about the folkloric tale of Yernagate the giant. As&nbsp;protector of the New Forest, the giant helps an old woman defy the man who is single-handedly cutting down all the forest’s trees. “The young people we worked with spoke about how the doom mentality makes them feel powerless,” explains Miles, who grew up on the edge of the New Forest. “As though they can’t do anything, as&nbsp;though it’s all lost. We are using the&nbsp;story of Yernagate to show that something can be done.”</p>    <p>A collaboration between community arts organisation Theatre for Life and the New Forest National Park Authority, the place creates a&nbsp;sense of intimacy through localisation. “We looked at the effects&nbsp;of climate change in our own community,” explains actor Imani Okoh. They spoke to climate scientists, marine biologists and rangers. Supported by the YouCAN (Youth for Climate Action for Nature) scheme, the&nbsp;show has been built round the young participants’ responses and concerns. “They felt strongly about the&nbsp;invisible parts of climate change like air pollution,” says Miles, “which then became the focus of the story.” They read about the tragic death of Ella Kissi-Debrah, a nine-year-old who <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/jan/25/mother-of-girl-who-died-from-air-pollution-sues-uk-government"">died from an asthma attack</a>, the first person in the world to have air pollution listed as the cause of death. “It’s not our grandchildren’s lifetime,” Miles says soberly. “It’s ours.”</p> <p>In their story, Yernagate helps a young, isolated, asthmatic teenager, played by Okoh, as she struggles with the weight of climate anxiety. Power is handed to their young audiences through the idea of a community garden, a small act of accessible protest, with a mother inspired by Ella’s mum Rosamund “who is quietly doing everything she can”, Miles says. When they took it to show a group of young people living in social housing in Southampton, the response was effusive. “They said it represented them and their community,” Okoh says. “It’s their world, their high rise, their home.” By making their story local, the climate emergency becomes easier to grasp, easier to fight.</p> <p>Though the topic is thorny, comedy&nbsp;snakes in, with The Beautiful Future Is Coming rolling its eyes at sustainable business as a marketing consultant takes a plane to pitch to Greenpeace. With Birmingham Hippodrome’s New&nbsp;Musical Theatre department, Jack&nbsp;Godfrey and Ellie Coote have been experimenting with the same idea. “We wanted to make something entertaining and silly that also talks about these really serious issues,” says Godfrey. “I don’t think those things need to be in opposition to each other.”</p> <p>Their new musical is a romantic comedy. Pitching the Earth and humanity as two partners in a troubled relationship, <a href=""https://www.pleasance.co.uk/event/hot-mess"">Hot Mess</a> premieres at the Edinburgh fringe this year. The duo wanted to write a show that spoke to the climate crisis, but it took a breakup and a bike ride for the idea to click. “I was writing angsty breakup songs,” Godfrey laughs, “and I was cycling to work when I realised a song I’d written could be sung from the perspective of humanity to the Earth.”</p> <p>Drawing out the metaphor, they played the beats of a romantic relationship against Earth’s bumpy history with its inhabitants. “There are some dark moments which will feel relatable for people when they think about their own relationships,” says Coote, “and some will feel existential when thinking about our relationship with the planet.” But they wanted to root it in humour, not fear. “We wanted to disarm the audience with a familiar story,” she says, “and let them feel their way through.” Like the teams in Bristol and Southampton, they felt the facts of the climate crisis&nbsp;too easily slip from our fingers. “We&nbsp;wanted to use the superpower of&nbsp;musical theatre,” says Godfrey, “which is to move people.”</p>    <p>These plays seek to take what often feels invisible and lay it out for an audience to see more clearly. Abroad, a&nbsp;stampede of animals are confronting this challenge on even larger stages. In&nbsp;2021, a 12ft-tall puppet of a 10-year-old Syrian girl, called <a href=""https://www.walkwithamal.org/"">Little Amal</a>, walked 8,000km (5,000 miles) from Turkey to the UK to raise awareness of&nbsp;the urgent plight of refugees. This&nbsp;summer, the same team began a <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/apr/25/puppet-herd-animals-climate-crisis-africa-arctic-circle-little-amal"">20,000km (12,400 mile) journey</a>, shepherding <a href=""https://www.theherds.org/"">The Herds</a>, a group of lifesize <a href=""https://www.theherds.org/"">animal puppets</a>, from the Congo basin to the Arctic Circle. “The&nbsp;people who depend on the forest are feeling the climate crisis now,” says David Lan, one of the core team and former artistic director of the Young Vic. “Animals are already moving from their ancient habitat because the Earth is too hot. We wanted to dramatise this to express the way life is already being strongly affected by what’s happening to the climate.”</p> <p>The project leapfrogs people’s resistance to admit that the climate emergency is already making our home uninhabitable by placing it in front of them, in public spaces. “Climate scientists we’ve spoken to say there is good, meaningful data,” says Lan, “but they need artists to tell it as a story people can connect with.” The idea came from taking Little Amal to the UN’s climate summit in Glasgow in 2021. The Herds will grow in size, from roughly 30 in Kinshasa to more than a hundred by the time it reaches the Arctic Circle, with new species added along the way by South African puppet company Ukwanda. “I say with confidence that the animals will have power,” Lan says, “when they rampage into city centres.”The extraordinary scale of the project, which will pass through London and Manchester in late June and early July, is part of its power. “We&nbsp;hope it being so extensive expresses that you can do big things,” Lan says. “You can bring people together. You can change things.” Like&nbsp;Bristol Old Vic and Theatre for&nbsp;Life creating local connections, The&nbsp;Herds is made possible by its partnerships; Little Amal formed collaborations between organisations who had existed next door to each other for years but had never thought to work together. “The provocation is&nbsp;to engage,” Lan says. “Find the place&nbsp;where your energy can be effective, where you can connect to&nbsp;other people.”</p> <p>By shifting the narrative from doom to hope, these theatre-makers aim to inspire conversation, action and collaboration. “We can only do it together,” Lan says of changing our minds and our future. “Doing it by instruction is not going to work. It’s&nbsp;got to be felt.” While their stories take different forms, they all believe in&nbsp;the power of the emotion that can gather in a crowd. “Hope is built on community,” notes Miles. “All it takes is a theatre’s worth of people to do something big.”</p> <p><em><a href=""https://bristololdvic.org.uk/whats-on/the-beautiful-future-is-coming"">The Beautiful Future Is Coming</a> is at Bristol Old Vic, </em><em>15 May to 7 June</em><em>; <a href=""https://www.pleasance.co.uk/event/hot-mess"">Hot&nbsp;Mess</a> is at Pleasance Two</em><em>, Edinburgh, </em><em>30&nbsp;July to 25 August</em><em>; <a href=""https://www.mayflower.org.uk/whats-on/bringing-the-outside-in-2025/"">Bringing the Outside In</a> is at Mayflower, Southampton, </em><em>15 July</em><em>, then touring in 2026; <a href=""https://www.theherds.org/"">The Herds</a> visits London, </em><em>27 to 29 June</em><em>, and Manchester, </em><em>3 to 5 July</em><em>.</em></p>",news
Madeleine Watts: ‘Climate change should be in everyone’s writing right now’,"<p>There is a hole in the heart of Madeleine Watts’ melancholic second novel Elegy, Southwest. “A really big, and expensive, hole,” says Lewis, one half of the married couple whose desert road trip forms the novel’s narrative arc. The hole, a land artwork in progress, is titled “Negative Capability” after “a quality that Keats believed the best artists possessed: the ability to stay open to doubt and uncertainty”. It’s a quality Watts has in spades.</p> <p>“My general personality is to go up close to the thing that makes me sad or frightened. I go up close and tinker around and it feels like I gain a modicum of control. It doesn’t necessarily feel cathartic but I’ve done something,” the Australian author says.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/books/ng-interactive/2025/feb/27/the-savage-suburbia-of-helen-garner-i-wanted-to-dong-martin-amis-with-a-bat"">The savage suburbia of Helen Garner: ‘I wanted to dong Martin Amis with a bat’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In Elegy, Southwest, the frightening and sad things include the death of a parent and a miscarriage, as well as disappearances: water, animals, people, love. It’s a novel of apocalypses, imminent and historical, paused beside and sped past as the couple attempt to follow the elusive, overused Colorado River.</p>    <p>“I was so obsessed with this river that’s so managed and contained, and allows this part of the world to exist but because of hubris and climate change, is threatened,” says Watts. “Theoretically you should be able to follow the river all the way down but you can’t. It doesn’t meet the sea. It hasn’t for years.”</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2019/oct/18/saved-for-later-sign-up-for-guardian-australias-culture-and-lifestyle-email?CMP=copyembed"">Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>Watts lent her obsession to the novel’s protagonist, Eloise, who researches her dissertation about the river while grieving multiple losses – past, present and future. Like Watts, Eloise is an Australian who moved to New York and experienced the same uncanny sense of being “home and yet not at home” that Watts encountered when treading on gumnuts in California.</p> <p>The genesis of the novel lies in two road trips Watts took through the American south-west. The author felt drawn to the “pernicious mythology” of the road and the west: “It’s the America you are singing about in all the songs. I was interested in exploring this Americana from an outsider perspective,” she says.</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>Thinking about having kids is a gesture toward hope in the future. You are invested in the world still being there</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Unsure what to make of the extensive notes from these trips, Watts sat on them through two crises: the 2019-20 bushfire season – during which she experienced the frightening silence of the burned bush while visiting her mother in Sydney’s Blue Mountains – and the Covid pandemic. Trapped during lockdowns in various locations that were neither Sydney nor her adopted home of New York, Watts felt “physically stuck in places that were not where I was imaginatively”. She used Google maps to shape her notes into one fictional road trip taken during the 2018 California wildfires.</p> <p>Somewhere between LA and Phoenix, Eloise begins to suspect she’s pregnant. Watts drafted what she refers to in Delilloesque terms as the novel’s “reproductive event” at the time <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/24/roe-v-wade-overturned-abortion-summary-supreme-court"">Roe v Wade was overturned</a>. She remembers riding the New York subway on the morning after the ruling. “It was boiling hot, everyone was dripping and I saw so many women on the verge of tears or actually crying. There was no sense of community. Everybody was really afraid and everybody was mourning and everybody was on their own,” she says. “My experience of reproductive events is that it’s the most private thing you can experience.”</p> <p>As a woman in her 30s, Watts feels she’s now at a flashpoint. “I am a millennial thinking about reproduction and climate change,” she says. “Thinking about having kids is a gesture toward hope in the future. You are invested in the world still being there.”</p>    <p>Elegy, Southwest is Watts’ second work of climate fiction after her 2020 debut, The Inland Sea. At the time, she didn’t think of that first book in those terms – “it was billed as a ‘millennial novel’,” she says – but found herself often asked by interviewers to talk about writing into the climate crisis.</p> <p>“I didn’t have good answers,” she says. “So as I was being asked those questions, I was basically forming ideas. In many ways this book is an answer to questions I was being asked about the first.”</p> <p>Since then she’s taught courses on writing into nature and climate change at Columbia University, thinking through the implications of Mark Fisher and Daisy Hildyard’s theories for writers who want to respond to the crisis. Some of these ideas made it into the novel, as did “a sense of weariness, the feeling of being a bit tired of these things”.</p> <p>Perhaps then, this is where genres meet. At the complicated intersections of wildfire and weariness, hope, thrill, heartbreak and Negative Capability, all millennial novels are climate novels, too. “I think that climate change should be in everyone’s writing right now,” says Watts. “It’s there. It has to be – and if it’s not, it’s being ignored.”</p> <ul> <li><p><em><a href=""https://ultimopress.com.au/collections/madeleine-watts/products/elegy-southwest"">Elegy, Southwest</a> by Madeleine Watts is out now through Ultimo Press ($34.99)</em></p></li> </ul>",news
Britain’s forests need help to adapt to the changing climate | Letters,"<p>Your article paints a bleak picture of the challenges facing reforestation in the UK (<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jul/10/britain-ancient-woodlands-failing-regenerate-forests-climate-drought-heat-disease-deer-hope-aoe"">In some UK woodlands, every young tree has died. What’s going wrong? 10 July</a>). The failure of natural regeneration – driven by drought, heat, disease and deer grazing – is not just a crisis for ancient woodlands, it’s a stark warning for the future of all UK forestry.</p> <p>This ecological breakdown reveals a fundamental flaw in our current approach: we are too focused on the number of saplings in the ground and not enough on their long-term resilience. Whether through natural regeneration or new planting schemes, tree survival must be the priority. With mortality rates increasing by 90%, as the article highlights, it’s clear that traditional methods are no longer fit for purpose in a changing climate.</p> <p>To build forests that can withstand future conditions, we must invest in resilience from the outset. Research into techniques that improve sapling survivability is essential to protecting ancient woodlands and establishing new ones. Innovative approaches – such as vertical farming to produce climate-adapted saplings and biochar-enhanced substrates to improve soil health – are already showing promise. These methods can yield stronger, faster-growing trees with significantly higher survival rates.</p> <p>Our ancient woodlands are among the UK’s most treasured natural assets. If we are to protect and restore them – while ensuring they continue to absorb carbon and support biodiversity – we need a new approach to UK forestry, one with resilience and survivability at its core.<br><strong>Alastair Collier</strong><br><em>Chief research and development officer, A Healthier Earth</em></p> <p>• I was really interested to read that saplings weren’t thriving in ancient forests. It is quite the opposite in my garden.

This is both from flowerpots and flowerbeds. When I cut them back they seem to grow back even stronger. What is happening that a south London garden seems desperate to become a forest and ancient forests are giving up?<br><strong>Martin Cooper</strong><br><em>Bromley, London</em></p>",news
Glut of early fruit and veg hits UK as climate change closes ‘hungry gap’,"<p>A glut of early strawberries, aubergines and tomatoes has hit Britain with the dry, warm weather eliminating the usual “hungry gap”, growers say.</p> <p>It has been a sunny, very dry spring, with the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/may/01/warmest-start-to-may-on-record-in-uk-as-temperatures-prompt-wildfire-warnings"">warmest start to May on record</a> and temperatures predicted to reach up to 30C at the earliest point on record, forecasters have said.</p> <p>Nick Haigh, a grower at the Community Farm south of Bristol, said many of their Mediterranean vegetables had come on weeks earlier than expected.</p> <p>“It feels like it’s the middle of May already,” he said, explaining that they have loads and loads of crops right now, tomatoes, aubergines, cucumbers, peppers, that were all ready for planting two or three weeks early. “We are crazy busy already. We are feeling the push right now.”</p> <p>Usually this time of year is <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jan/13/uk-faces-broccoli-and-cauliflower-shortage-this-spring"">known as the “hungry gap”</a>, when winter vegetables have run out and consumers are waiting for the summer crops to arrive. However, the sunny, dry weather has eliminated this, he said.</p> <p>“A few months ago we thought it would be the worst hungry gap ever, now we are saying there is not going to be a hungry gap. We got really poor harvests last year – we didn’t get very much squash, for example – so we didn’t have the storage vegetables that would usually get us through the hungry gap. Last year was awful, it was completely wet.”</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/apr/05/farmers-in-england-fear-for-nature-after-sustainable-farming-funding-frozen"">Farmers in England fear for nature after sustainable farming funding frozen</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The extremes of weather, made more acute by climate breakdown, are catching farmers by surprise as they never know whether they will have to deal with floods or drought.</p> <p>“You just can’t predict the climate any more. What might be your predictable dates you might plant things by just don’t work any more,” he said. “We are having to try to be more adaptable to different techniques based on the climate. It’s keeping us on our toes for sure. Some rain would be great, though, we are looking at the weather waiting for the rain.”</p> <p>Kew Gardens, in south-west London, has noticed a glut of berries coming up early.</p> <p>Hélèna Dove, the head of the kitchen garden at Kew, said: “The recent warm weather is really showing how much our growing seasons are shifting. Traditionally, a good kitchen gardener would be proud to have ripe strawberries by Wimbledon as it would demonstrate their skill and expertise. We already have ripe strawberries in the kitchen garden at Kew Gardens, and it’s only April.”</p> <p>She said gardeners were experimenting with stone and tropical fruits, which do not usually fare well in the UK’s traditionally mild climate: “The warm spring means crops like citrus, kiwi, and tropical plants are thriving earlier, with longer seasons and better yields. We’re even growing peaches, apricots, and nectarines outside currently, something that would have been unthinkable in previous years due to the risk of late frosts and lack of early pollinators.</p> <p>“This time of year is also known as the hungry gap for these early pollinators, once the winter crops have ended but the new season’s plantings are not yet ready to harvest, but with plants such as calendula flowering early, there is a reliable food source this year. While some traditional fruits, such as apples, are struggling, this is an opportunity to rethink what we plant, working with the climate to save energy, water, and potentially even reduce imports.”</p> <p>Farmers are, on the whole, enjoying the sunny growing season. Dale Robinson, supply chain head at the organic vegetable box company Riverford, said: “This spring has been one of the warmest many of us can remember, bringing a real sense of joy and hope to our fields. Crops like purple sprouting broccoli and wild garlic have thrived, and the early warmth has allowed for timely planting of main crops. It’s a welcome change from the delays caused by last year’s wet winter – the wettest on record.</p> <p>“While we celebrate these favourable conditions, our growers remain mindful of the increasing unpredictability brought about by climate change. The real challenge lies not in the gradual shifts, but in the erratic weather extremes – sudden frosts, hailstorms, droughts – all of which can undo months of hard work in a single day.”</p> <p>• This article was amended on 7 May 2025 to clarify that Nick Haigh was referring to the Community Farm’s Mediterranean vegetables being ready to plant out earlier than usual, rather than being ready to harvest now.</p>",news
"Farmer’s house in danger from climate change, court told in RWE case","<p>A Peruvian farmer’s home is in “concrete danger” from climate change, a court has heard, in the resumption of a decade-long legal battle to get German coal giant RWE to contribute to flood defences in the Andes.</p> <p>Lawyers for Saúl Luciano Lliuya, who say his home is threatened by rapidly melting glaciers, told the upper regional court in Hamm on Wednesday that the risk of extreme flooding represented a breach of civil law.</p> <p>Lliuya filed a case in 2015 against RWE, one of the world’s biggest greenhouse gas polluters but which has never operated in Peru. </p> <p>The case was thrown out by a lower court in Essen but, on appeal in 2017, a court in Hamm found the case to be “admissible”, potentially opening the door for fossil fuel companies to be held liable in civil courts for global harms.</p> <p>“This case is just the beginning,” said Roda Verheyen, Lliuya’s lawyer. “It’s a trampoline for similar cases.”</p> <p>The case against RWE, which has dragged out over several years because of bureaucracy and the coronavirus pandemic, highlights a key difficulty in legal efforts to attribute personal harm to carbon pollution. </p> <p>The judges heard differing evaluations of the chance of climate-fuelled floods hitting Lliuya’s home in the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/mar/26/glacial-lake-outburst-floods-palcacocha-huaraz-andes-peru-climate-crisis"">Andean town of Huaraz, large parts of which were wiped out in 1941</a> when Lake Palcacocha overflowed and triggered floods that killed thousands.</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/feb/04/the-last-drops-of-our-water-how-a-mine-left-some-of-perus-poorest-high-and-dry"">‘The last drops of our water’: how a mine left some of Peru’s poorest high and dry </a> </p> </aside>  <p>Scientists have established that the pollution from burning fossil fuels has heated the planet and melted glaciers, which are projected to lose one quarter of their global mass by 2100 even in a best-case scenario for cutting emissions. </p> <p>But the chance of the Palcacocha flooding Lliuya’s home – as well as the fraction of that they can attribute to climate change – is harder to quantify.</p> <p>Rolf Katzenbach, a court-appointed expert, estimated the risk of a glacier lake outburst flood in Lake Palcacocha in the next 30 years at about 1%. </p> <p>He criticised the methodologies of some scientific papers cited by the plaintiff and dismissed research that relied on results from better-studied Alpine regions, for which scientists have more data, because of differences in local geology.</p> <p>Verheyen countered that Katzenbach’s assessment had relied on a limited sample of historical events and failed to properly factor in the effects of climate change, such as melting permafrost.</p> <p>A verdict is expected on 14 April.

The structure of the climate debate,"First-best climate policy is a uniform carbon tax which gradually rises over
time. Civil servants have complicated climate policy to expand bureaucracies,
politicians to create rents. Environmentalists have exaggerated climate change
to gain influence, other activists have joined the climate bandwagon. Opponents
to climate policy have attacked the weaknesses in climate research. The climate
debate is convoluted and polarized as a result, and climate policy complex.
Climate policy should become easier and more rational as the Paris Agreement
has shifted climate policy back towards national governments. Changing
political priorities, austerity, and a maturing bureaucracy should lead to a
more constructive climate debate.",science
"Climate Science and Control Engineering: Insights, Parallels, and
  Connections","Climate science is the multidisciplinary field that studies the Earth's
climate and its evolution. At the very core of climate science are
indispensable climate models that predict future climate scenarios, inform
policy decisions, and dictate how a country's economy should change in light of
the changing climate. Climate models capture a wide range of interacting
dynamic processes via extremely complex ordinary and partial differential
equations. To model these large-scale complex processes, climate science
leverages supercomputers, advanced simulations, and statistical methods to
predict future climate. An area of engineering that is rarely studied in
climate science is control engineering. Given that climate systems are
inherently dynamic, it is intuitive to analyze them within the framework of
dynamic system science. This perspective has been underexplored in the
literature. In this manuscript, we provide a tutorial that: (i) introduces the
control engineering community to climate dynamics and modeling, including
spatiotemporal scales and challenges in climate modeling; (ii) offers a fresh
perspective on climate models from a control systems viewpoint; and (iii)
explores the relevance and applicability of various advanced graph and network
control-based approaches in building a physics-informed framework for learning,
control and estimation in climate systems. We also present simple and then more
complex climate models, depicting fundamental ideas and processes that are
instrumental in building climate change projections. This tutorial also builds
parallels and observes connections between various contemporary problems at the
forefront of climate science and their control theoretic counterparts. We
specifically observe that an abundance of climate science problems can be
linguistically reworded and mathematically framed as control theoretic ones.",science
Baumol's Climate Disease,"We investigate optimal carbon abatement in a dynamic general equilibrium
climate-economy model with endogenous structural change. By differentiating the
production of investment from consumption, we show that social cost of carbon
can be conceived as a reduction in physical capital. In addition, we
distinguish two final sectors in terms of productivity growth and climate
vulnerability. We theoretically show that heterogeneous climate vulnerability
results in a climate-induced version of Baumol's cost disease. Further, if
climate-vulnerable sectors have high (low) productivity growth, climate impact
can either ameliorate (aggravate) the Baumol's cost disease, call for less
(more) stringent climate policy. We conclude that carbon abatement should not
only factor in unpriced climate capital, but also be tailored to Baumol's cost
and climate diseases.",science
You are right. I am ALARMED -- But by Climate Change Counter Movement,"The world is facing the challenge of climate crisis. Despite the consensus in
scientific community about anthropogenic global warming, the web is flooded
with articles spreading climate misinformation. These articles are carefully
constructed by climate change counter movement (cccm) organizations to
influence the narrative around climate change. We revisit the literature on
climate misinformation in social sciences and repackage it to introduce in the
community of NLP. Despite considerable work in detection of fake news, there is
no misinformation dataset available that is specific to the domain.of climate
change. We try to bridge this gap by scraping and releasing articles with known
climate change misinformation.",science
Climate Change Conspiracy Theories on Social Media,"One of the critical emerging challenges in climate change communication is
the prevalence of conspiracy theories. This paper discusses some of the major
conspiracy theories related to climate change found in a large Twitter corpus.
We use a state-of-the-art stance detection method to find whether conspiracy
theories are more popular among Disbelievers or Believers of climate change. We
then analyze which conspiracy theory is more popular than the others and how
popularity changes with climate change belief. We find that Disbelievers of
climate change are overwhelmingly responsible for sharing messages with
conspiracy theory-related keywords, and not all conspiracy theories are equally
shared. Lastly, we discuss the implications of our findings for climate change
communication.",science
Hurricanes Increase Climate Change Conversations on Twitter,"The public understanding of climate change plays a critical role in
translating climate science into climate action. In the public discourse,
climate impacts are often discussed in the context of extreme weather events.
Here, we analyse 65 million Twitter posts and 240 thousand news media articles
related to 18 major hurricanes from 2010 to 2022 to clarify how hurricanes
impact the public discussion around climate change. First, we analyse news
content and show that climate change is the most prominent non-hurricane
specific topic discussed by the news media in relation to hurricanes. Second,
we perform a comparative analysis between reliable and questionable news media
outlets, finding that the language around climate change varies between news
media providers. Finally, using geolocated data, we show that accounts in
regions affected by hurricanes discuss climate change at a significantly higher
rate than accounts in unaffected areas, with references to climate change
increasing by, on average, 80% after impact, and up to 200% for the largest
hurricanes. Our findings demonstrate how hurricanes have a key impact on the
public awareness of climate change.",science
"Trend and Thoughts: Understanding Climate Change Concern using Machine
  Learning and Social Media Data","Nowadays social media platforms such as Twitter provide a great opportunity
to understand public opinion of climate change compared to traditional survey
methods. In this paper, we constructed a massive climate change Twitter dataset
and conducted comprehensive analysis using machine learning. By conducting
topic modeling and natural language processing, we show the relationship
between the number of tweets about climate change and major climate events; the
common topics people discuss climate change; and the trend of sentiment. Our
dataset was published on Kaggle
(\url{https://www.kaggle.com/leonshangguan/climate-change-tweets-ids-until-aug-2021})

Financial climate risk: a review of recent advances and key challenges,"The document provides an overview of financial climate risks. It delves into
how climate change impacts the global financial system, distinguishing between
physical risks (such as extreme weather events) and transition risks (stemming
from policy changes and economic transitions towards low carbon technologies).
The paper underlines the complexity of accurately defining financial climate
risk, citing the integration of climate science with financial risk analysis as
a significant challenge. The paper highlights the pivotal role of microfinance
institutions (MFIs) in addressing financial climate risk, especially for
populations vulnerable to climate change. The document emphasizes the
importance of updating risk management practices within MFIs to explicitly
include climate risk assessments and suggests leveraging technology to improve
these practices.",science
Mapping the Climate Change Landscape on TikTok,"Social media platforms shape climate action discourse. Mapping these online
conversations is essential for effective communication strategies. TikTok's
climate discussions are particularly relevant given its young,
climate-concerned audience. In this work, we collect the first TikTok dataset
on climate topics. We collected 590K videos from 14K creators along with their
follower networks. By applying topic modeling to the video descriptions, we map
the topics discussed on the platform on a climate taxonomy that we construct by
consolidating existing categorizations. Results show TikTok creators primarily
approach climate through the angle of lifestyle and dietary choices. By
examining semantic connections between topics, we identified non-climate
""gateway"" topics that could draw new audiences into climate discussions.",science
"What shapes climate change perceptions in Africa? A random forest
  approach","Climate change perceptions are fundamental for adaptation and environmental
policy support. Although Africa is one of the most vulnerable regions to
climate change, little research has focused on how climate change is perceived
in the continent. Using random forest methodology, we analyse Afrobarometer
data (N = 45,732), joint with climatic data, to explore what shapes climate
change perceptions in Africa. We include 5 different dimensions of climate
change perceptions: awareness, belief in its human cause, risk perception, need
to stop it and self-efficacy. Results indicate that perceived agriculture
conditions are crucial for perceiving climate change. Country-level factors and
long-term changes in local weather conditions are among the most important
predictors. Moreover, education level, access to information, poverty,
authoritarian values, and trust in institutions shape individual climate change
perceptions. Demographic effects -- including religion -- seem negligible.
These findings suggest policymakers and environmental communicators how to
frame climate change in Africa to raise awareness, gather public support and
induce adaptation.",science
A Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment Framework: A Spatial Approach,"Climate change is affecting every known society, especially for small farmers
in Low-Income Countries because they depend heavily on rain, seasonality
patterns, and known temperature ranges. To build climate change resilient
communities among rural farmers, the first step is to understand the impact of
climate change on the population. This paper proposes a Climate Change
Vulnerability Assessment Framework (CCVAF) to assess climate change
vulnerabilities among rural farmers. The CCVAF framework uses information and
communication technology (ICT) to assess climate change vulnerabilities among
rural farmers by integrating both community level and individual household
level indicators. The CCVAF was instantiated into a GIS-based web application
named THRIVE for different decision-makers to better assess how climate change
is affecting rural farmers in Western Honduras. Qualitative evaluation of the
THRIVE showed that it is an innovative and useful tool. The CCVAF contributes
to not only the knowledge base of the climate change vulnerability assessment
but also the design science literature by providing guidelines to design a
class of climate change vulnerability assessment solutions.",science
"Indexing and Visualization of Climate Change Narratives Using BERT and
  Causal Extraction","In this study, we propose a methodology to extract, index, and visualize
``climate change narratives'' (stories about the connection between causal and
consequential events related to climate change). We use two natural language
processing methods, BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
Transformers) and causal extraction, to textually analyze newspaper articles on
climate change to extract ``climate change narratives.'' The novelty of the
methodology could extract and quantify the causal relationships assumed by the
newspaper's writers. Looking at the extracted climate change narratives over
time, we find that since 2018, an increasing number of narratives suggest the
impact of the development of climate change policy discussion and the
implementation of climate change-related policies on corporate behaviors,
macroeconomics, and price dynamics. We also observed the recent emergence of
narratives focusing on the linkages between climate change-related policies and
monetary policy. Furthermore, there is a growing awareness of the negative
impacts of natural disasters (e.g., abnormal weather and severe floods) related
to climate change on economic activities, and this issue might be perceived as
a new challenge for companies and governments. The methodology of this study is
expected to be applied to a wide range of fields, as it can analyze causal
relationships among various economic topics, including analysis of inflation
expectation or monetary policy communication strategy.",science
"Detection, attribution, and modeling of climate change: key open issues","The CMIP global climate models (GCMs) assess that nearly 100% of global
surface warming observed between 1850-1900 and 2011-2020 is attributable to
anthropogenic drivers like greenhouse gas emissions. These models also generate
future climate projections based on shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs),
aiding in risk assessment and the development of costly Net-Zero climate
mitigation strategies. Yet, the CMIP GCMs face significant scientific
challenges in attributing and modeling climate change, particularly in
capturing natural climate variability over multiple timescales throughout the
Holocene. Other key concerns include the reliability of global surface
temperature records, the accuracy of solar irradiance models, and the
robustness of climate sensitivity estimates. Global warming estimates may be
overstated due to uncorrected non-climatic biases, and the GCMs may
significantly underestimate solar and astronomical influences on climate
variations. The equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) to radiative forcing
could be lower than commonly assumed; empirical findings suggest ECS values
lower than 3 K and possibly even closer to 1.1 +/- 0.4 K. Empirical models
incorporating natural variability suggest that the 21st-century global warming
may remain moderate, even under SSP scenarios that do not necessitate Net-Zero
emission policies. These findings raise important questions regarding the
necessity and urgency of implementing aggressive climate mitigation strategies.
While GCMs remain essential tools for climate research and policymaking, their
scientific limitations underscore the need for more refined modeling approaches
to ensure accurate future climate assessments. Addressing uncertainties related
to climate change detection, natural variability, solar influences, and climate
sensitivity to radiative forcing will enhance predictions and better inform
sustainable climate strategies.",science
Uncertainty in climate science and climate policy,"This essay, written by a statistician and a climate scientist, describes our
view of the gap that exists between current practice in mainstream climate
science, and the practical needs of policymakers charged with exploring
possible interventions in the context of climate change. By `mainstream' we
mean the type of climate science that dominates in universities and research
centres, which we will term `academic' climate science, in contrast to `policy'
climate science; aspects of this distinction will become clearer in what
follows.
  In a nutshell, we do not think that academic climate science equips climate
scientists to be as helpful as they might be, when involved in climate policy
assessment. Partly, we attribute this to an over-investment in high resolution
climate simulators, and partly to a culture that is uncomfortable with the
inherently subjective nature of climate uncertainty.",science
"A large-scale bibliometric analysis of global climate change research
  between 2001 and 2018","Global climate change is attracting widespread scientific, political, and
public attention owing to the involvement of international initiatives such as
the Paris Agreement and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. We
present a large-scale bibliometric analysis based on approximately 120,000
climate change publications between 2001 and 2018 to examine how climate change
is studied in scientific research. Our analysis provides an overview of
scientific knowledge, shifts of research hotspots, global geographical
distribution of research, and focus of individual countries. In our analysis,
we identify five key fields in climate change research: physical sciences,
paleoclimatology, climate-change ecology, climate technology, and climate
policy. We draw the following key conclusions: (1) Over the investigated time
period, the focus of climate change research has shifted from understanding the
climate system toward climate technologies and policies, such as efficient
energy use and legislation. (2) There is an imbalance in scientific production
between developed and developing countries. (3) Geography, national demands,
and national strategies have been important drivers that influence the research
interests and concerns of researchers in different countries. Our study can be
used by researchers and policy makers to reflect on the directions in which
climate change research is developing and discuss priorities for future
research.",science
"The Cost of Climate Action: Experimental Evidence on the Impact of
  Climate Information on Charitable Donations to Climate Activism","We examine the propensity of individuals to donate to climate activism,
evaluating the impact of different informational treatments on an incentive
compatible charitable donation and stated climate change-related concerns.
Participants were evaluated on climate literacy and general climate attitudes
before being randomly assigned to a treatment which provided either education
or neutral language about climate change, either with or without images of
protest. After the treatment, participants engaged in an incentive compatible
dictator game. We find that participants gave more to climate activism than
seen in previous dictator game and charitable giving experiments, in both
average amount given and proportion of participants who gave their entire
endowment. However, we determine that climate activism information negatively
influenced the amount of money donated. We also found that protest imagery
moderated this negative effect and had a positive significant effect of
increasing participants' climate concern. Finally, we found that the climate
concern was significantly positively correlated with donations, while being a
male was significantly negatively associated with donation amounts.",science
"NLP for Climate Policy: Creating a Knowledge Platform for Holistic and
  Effective Climate Action","Climate change is a burning issue of our time, with the Sustainable
Development Goal (SDG) 13 of the United Nations demanding global climate
action. Realizing the urgency, in 2015 in Paris, world leaders signed an
agreement committing to taking voluntary action to reduce carbon emissions.
However, the scale, magnitude, and climate action processes vary globally,
especially between developed and developing countries. Therefore, from
parliament to social media, the debates and discussions on climate change
gather data from wide-ranging sources essential to the policy design and
implementation. The downside is that we do not currently have the mechanisms to
pool the worldwide dispersed knowledge emerging from the structured and
unstructured data sources.
  The paper thematically discusses how NLP techniques could be employed in
climate policy research and contribute to society's good at large. In
particular, we exemplify symbiosis of NLP and Climate Policy Research via four
methodologies. The first one deals with the major topics related to climate
policy using automated content analysis. We investigate the opinions
(sentiments) of major actors' narratives towards climate policy in the second
methodology. The third technique explores the climate actors' beliefs towards
pro or anti-climate orientation. Finally, we discuss developing a Climate
Knowledge Graph.
  The present theme paper further argues that creating a knowledge platform
would help in the formulation of a holistic climate policy and effective
climate action. Such a knowledge platform would integrate the policy actors'
varied opinions from different social sectors like government, business, civil
society, and the scientific community. The research outcome will add value to
effective climate action because policymakers can make informed decisions by
looking at the diverse public opinion on a comprehensive platform.",science
ClimateSet: A Large-Scale Climate Model Dataset for Machine Learning,"Climate models have been key for assessing the impact of climate change and
simulating future climate scenarios. The machine learning (ML) community has
taken an increased interest in supporting climate scientists' efforts on
various tasks such as climate model emulation, downscaling, and prediction
tasks. Many of those tasks have been addressed on datasets created with single
climate models. However, both the climate science and ML communities have
suggested that to address those tasks at scale, we need large, consistent, and
ML-ready climate model datasets. Here, we introduce ClimateSet, a dataset
containing the inputs and outputs of 36 climate models from the Input4MIPs and
CMIP6 archives. In addition, we provide a modular dataset pipeline for
retrieving and preprocessing additional climate models and scenarios. We
showcase the potential of our dataset by using it as a benchmark for ML-based
climate model emulation. We gain new insights about the performance and
generalization capabilities of the different ML models by analyzing their
performance across different climate models. Furthermore, the dataset can be
used to train an ML emulator on several climate models instead of just one.
Such a ""super emulator"" can quickly project new climate change scenarios,
complementing existing scenarios already provided to policymakers. We believe
ClimateSet will create the basis needed for the ML community to tackle
climate-related tasks at scale.",science
"ClimateChat: Designing Data and Methods for Instruction Tuning LLMs to
  Answer Climate Change Queries","As the issue of global climate change becomes increasingly severe, the demand
for research in climate science continues to grow. Natural language processing
technologies, represented by Large Language Models (LLMs), have been widely
applied to climate change-specific research, providing essential information
support for decision-makers and the public. Some studies have improved model
performance on relevant tasks by constructing climate change-related
instruction data and instruction-tuning LLMs. However, current research remains
inadequate in efficiently producing large volumes of high-precision instruction
data for climate change, which limits further development of climate change
LLMs. This study introduces an automated method for constructing instruction
data. The method generates instructions using facts and background knowledge
from documents and enhances the diversity of the instruction data through web
scraping and the collection of seed instructions. Using this method, we
constructed a climate change instruction dataset, named ClimateChat-Corpus,
which was used to fine-tune open-source LLMs, resulting in an LLM named
ClimateChat. Evaluation results show that ClimateChat significantly improves
performance on climate change question-and-answer tasks. Additionally, we
evaluated the impact of different base models and instruction data on LLM
performance and demonstrated its capability to adapt to a wide range of climate
change scientific discovery tasks, emphasizing the importance of selecting an
appropriate base model for instruction tuning. This research provides valuable
references and empirical support for constructing climate change instruction
data and training climate change-specific LLMs.",science
Climate Modeling and Bifurcation,"Many papers and monographs were written about the modeling the Earth climate
and its variability. However there is still an obvious need for a module that
presents the fundamentals of climate modeling to students at the undergraduate
level. The present educational paper attempts to fill in this gap. To this end
we collect in this paper the relevant climate data and present a simple zero
and one dimensional models for the mean temperature of the Earth. These models
can exhibit bifurcations from the present Earth climate to an ice age or a
""Venus type of climate"". The models are accompanied by Matlab programs which
enable the user to change the models parameters and explore the impact that
these changes might have on their predictions on Earth climate.",science
